## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Full-Stack Capability
> "I built a Streamlit frontend on top of the FastAPI backend. It demonstrates full-stack development with user authentication, session management, and real-time interactions."

### Role-Based UI
> "The interface adapts based on user role. When you login as a guest, you see 6 tools and guest-specific quick actions. Staff users see 10 tools with admin operations. This is enforced both in the UI and at the API level."

### Session Management
> "I use Streamlit's session state to manage user authentication, chat history, and agent configuration. The session persists across interactions until logout."

### Real-Time Agent Interaction
> "When you send a message, it's posted to the FastAPI endpoint with the user's email header. The backend builds a role-specific LangGraph agent, processes the message, and returns the response. The UI displays it with timestamps and avatars."

### Quick Actions
> "I added role-specific quick action buttons. These are pre-configured prompts for common tasks. Guests get booking-related actions, staff get administrative operations. It makes the demo more interactive."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API Offline" Error
**Problem:** Red dot in login page

**Solution:** Start the API server first:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Port Already in Use
**Problem:** Port 8501 already in use

**Solution:** Kill existing Streamlit process or use different port:
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Login Not Working
**Problem:** Can't login with credentials

**Solution:** Use exact credentials:
- `guest@hotel.com` / `guest123`
- `staff@hotel.com` / `staff123`

### Chat Not Responding
**Problem:** Messages sent but no response

**Solutions:**
1. Check API is running at http://localhost:8000
2. Check Groq API key in .env file
3. Check API logs for errors
